The repository covers topics such as installing and configuring Linux, managing users and groups, managing files and directories, managing services, and troubleshooting problems. I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for students who are taking Dr. Coronado's class, and for anyone who is interested in learning about sysadmin.
